                My Animation project is expressing the emotion of happiness. The animation shows a person meeting their
                friend in a park on their birthday, and then more friends show up unexpectedly and declare “Happy
                Birthday!” , surprising the person. This surprise birthday celebration brings the person happiness from
                feeling loved by their friends. I chose ovals and circles to represent the people because these were
                simple geometric shapes, I used various colors for skin tones to represent a diverse group of people, as
                well as diﬀerent colors for the bodys to represent diﬀerent clothing. I decided to have the first friend
                approach first, followed by the rest of the group to illustrate the surprise aspect of the celebration.
                This is also why I chose to have the Happy Birthday message float in after the group was already
                together, to give context to what was happening. The most challenging part of the project was getting
                the timing right and the text eﬀects.
