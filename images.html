                        This self portrait uses some of my favorite colors, blue and green. I have always gravitated
                        towards cool tones as they are a calming energy. I used simple geometric shapes to create
                        virtually every aspect of my self portrait. The only thing freehand was the eyebrows and hair
                        which I drew with the pencil tool. The inspiration for my image was a collection of selfies I
                        have in my phone from a trip I took to Fire Island a few summers ago.
